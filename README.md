Promlem Solving 101

Here you get a golden opportunity to flex those problem solving muscles, by using what you know about coding to fix this app!  The app when finished should beautifully display all of the element store in the apps state in thier own nifty little containers.  

Some of the problems will give you console logs, while the majority of them will not.  You will need to develop a thoughtful approach to solving these types of problems, or establish one while you work through the this exercise. 

Make sure to challenge what you think you know about what you think is going on, and take your time to read the code.  Follow the trail of information and fix the app.  Good luck!!!

to get started:

1. npm install
3. npm run build (builds bundle.js)
4. npm start (If using the provided server use "npm run server" instead)
